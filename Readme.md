# NodeJS File System Task

**This repository is created for NodeJS File System**

- This application creates a web server on `port 8000` with two endpoints.
  
- `/`: Provides instructions to visit `/write` endpoint to save the current timestamp.
   
- `/write`: Saves the current timestamp to a file named `dd-mm-yyyy-hh-mm-ss.txt`.
  
- The root endpoint generates a text file in a folder named `Current_TimeStamp` containing the current timestamp and sends its content as a response. 
  
- The `/getTextFiles` endpoint retrieves and returns a list of all text files in the same folder.


## NodeJS
  - It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version of a JS engine, and node.

## ExpressJS
  - Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a single page, multipage, and hybrid web application. It's a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes.
